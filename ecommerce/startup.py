"""Tasks that run once when the web server process boots.

The point of this module is that deploying the app should not require anyone to
remember a dashboard setting. Render (and Railway, Fly.io, Heroku) start the
service with the start command only; if the build step forgets
``manage.py migrate``, the database is missing tables the app needs and admins
get errors when saving. Running the migration here makes a plain
``gunicorn ecommerce.wsgi`` deploy correct on its own.

Everything below is idempotent, cheap when there is nothing to do, and never
fatal: a task that fails logs the problem and lets the site come up anyway,
because a running store with one stale row beats a store that will not boot.
